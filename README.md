# Riparian-Encroachment-Predictor-Kenya
This project aims to predict encroachment on riparian zones in Kenya using geospatial data and machine learning. Riparian zones are ecologically sensitive areas near water bodies and illegal encroachment poses a threat to water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem health. The project applies predictive modeling to help policymakers and natural resource managers identify areas at risk of encroachment supporting data-driven decision-making for environmental conservation.
